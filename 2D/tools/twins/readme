All codes:
   To use twins to filter the ugly data.

howsimilar_yc1.py: the original version from "Yan Chao"
   input: 
      face dataset path(the file structure of dataset path must be  'class/all_images')
   output:
      a series of txt file contains all the image-to-image similarity of one class.
      The number of output txt is the same as the number of class under face dataset path
      
howsimilar_two_dir.py: 
   input:
      face dataset path(the file structure of dataset path must be  'class/all_images')
   output:
      a series of txt contains the class-to class similarity of all class

howsimilar_two_dataset.py:
   input:
       Two face dataset path(the file structure of dataset path must be  'class/all_images')
   output:
       a series of txt when average similarity of two class are bigger than threshold
